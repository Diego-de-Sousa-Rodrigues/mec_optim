# m+e+c-preparation
This repository contains a list of notebook lectures aimed to prepare students for the math+econ+code masterclass.
It aims for students in the first year of a master to acquire basic techniques in optimization, numerical optimization and econometrics, and for second year master's students/first year graduate students to refresh their memories on the topics covered.

The list of topics covered are:
* Theory of Static Optimization
* Theory and algorithms of Dynamic Programming
* Numerical optimization methods: the Newtonian approach
* Numerical methods in econometrics
* Nested algorithms in econometrics: BLP and Rust
